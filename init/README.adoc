= Init Files

This directory contains information by subject. Breaking down `neovim` configuration into management files keeps me from having an unweildy configuration file.

The files are sorted into groups as follows:

* `00` - TODO's and random ideas.
* `01` - general `neovim` configuration.
* `02` - installs and configures plugin manager. Currently `vim-plug`.
* `03` - lists plugins to be installed.
* `04` - general configuration that is not `neovim` specific.
* `05` - mappings (for non-plugins).
* `06` - plugin configuration
* `07` - gui configuration (this can be a bit arbitrary)
* `10` - spelling
