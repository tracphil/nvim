= Neovim

This is my https://neovim.io[Neovim] configuration. After switching from `vim` I decided to make my configuration a bit more modular. `init.vim` sets up the modular nature  and of particular note is the link:init/README.adoc[README] for the `init` directory.

Installing my `neovim` setup on Fedora is pretty straight forward:

....
brew install neovim
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nvim
git clone git@github.com:tracphil/nvim.git $HOME/.config/nvim
nvim $HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim
....

I have `neovim` configured in such a way that it will create all of the required directories, install https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] and finally download all of the plugins listed in `$HOME/.config/nvim/init/03-plugins.vim`

If you want to make any changes to packages that are installed. You will want to use a different editor and edit `$HOME/.config/nvim/init/03-plugins.vim`.

If you have any ideas, questions or concerns, please open a https://github.com/tracphil/neovim/issues[an issue].

Thanks for looking around and I hope to hear from you soon!
